MongoDBLX - September 2014
=========

The Lisbon MongoDB User Group is a place for developers to learn more about the non-relational, open source, document-oriented database MongoDB.


> MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database and many of the key committers often travel to Europe. So if you are facing challenges with MySQL, Postgres or Oracle, and would like to explore a more flexible, scalable alternative, please join us at one of our friendly, monthly sessions in Lisbon.
